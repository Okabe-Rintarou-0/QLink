# QLink
A project from lesson SE2308.

### Basic Logic

+ Check horizontal straight line
+ Check vertical straight line 
+ Check line with one corner
+ Check line with two corner

### Tips

+ **Searching** based on **pruning** is feasible, but not so feasible when the size of map is very tremendous.
+ **Split** a complex function into small and independent ones.
+ Make full use of **SIGNAL/SLOT**, which is a good way to decouple your modules.
+ You can **cache** the found linkable square pairs instead of trying to find it again after each link.
